<p class="introduction">No heavyweight boxing champion got there by simply stepping into the ring. Getting to be a true heavyweight took training, practice, and focus. The same is true of becoming a GPA heavyweight. There is no magic formula for getting better grades. To improve your GPA, you must prepare, focus, and work hard.</p>

<p class="patternName">Instructions</p>
<p class="instructions">First, figure out where you want to study. Try a few rooms in the house. Take thirty minutes of working in your bedroom, then thirty minutes in the living room, then thirty minutes in the kitchen if there’s an appropriate workspace available. Try the rooms that make sense for you.</p>
<p class="instructions">In what room were you most productive?</p>

<p class="patternName">Blockquote -  (quotes from books, lectures, dictionary definitions, etc.)</p>
<blockquote>Existentialism has its roots in the nineteenth century works of philosophy by Soren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky. However, existentialism only became a full fledged movement after the Second World War, when French philosophers such as Albert Camus, Jean Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir began articulating its most famous form. Existentialism views the individual as the fundamental starting point for philosophical inquiry, especially focusing on the subjective nature of human rationality and the absurdity of the human condition.</blockquote>

<h1>Becoming a GPA Heavyweight</h1>
<p>No heavyweight boxing champion got there by simply stepping into the ring. Getting to be a true heavyweight took training, practice, and focus. The same is true of becoming a GPA heavyweight. There is no magic formula for getting better grades. To improve your GPA, you must prepare, focus, and work hard.</p>

<p>You also have to make sure that you prepare and work correctly, however. Simply going to a library for a few hours won’t do. In fact, if you find a library with really comfortable chairs, you might just sleep and not do any work. In order to guarantee that you will be a GPA Heavyweight, you have to plan, study in the right environment, and use your time wisely.</p>
<h2>Creating a Study Plan</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have to read a novel for your English class, create a lab report for your science class, and write an essay for your history class, all of which are due on the exact same Friday. The way to make sure you don’t do well on your assignments is to plan out your week like so:</p>
<h3>Lectures</h3>
<p>Taking notes during a class lecture, or any other kind of presentation, can be a trap. The temptation when taking notes is to write down everything you hear. This temptation must be avoided at all costs. Imagine you have an English teacher who introduces Jane Austen’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> with this brief information.</p>

<p class="instructions">The first step in great note taking is to come up with a <strong>personal shorthand</strong>: abbreviations, consolidations, and annotations that consolidate information in a way that makes sense to you. The real key is to find the big information and create an appropriate shorthand. The two paragraphs of lecture can look like this:</p>
<div class="example-answer"><ul>
<li>Jane Austen</li>
<ul>
<li>b. 1775</li>
<li>Daught of Angl min</li>
<li>Largely self-taught</li>
<li>Began writ 1790s</li>
<li>1st Novel: <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811)</li>
</ul>
<li><em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (PP)</li>

<li>Bennett Sisters courtship</li>
<li>Eliz Bennett--Mr. Darcy & Mr. Wickham</li>
<li>Free Indirect Speech--third person narration w/ character’s own manners and thoughts </li>
